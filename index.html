                I’m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chathura-weerasinghe-9a08bb213/"><em>Chathura Nirmal Weerasinghe</em></a>. An Electronic Engineering Undergraduate, specializing in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Moratuwa. I am passionate about <strong>Human-Computer Interaction, Assertive Augmentation,</strong> and <strong>Embedded Machine Learning.</strong>

                One of my notable projects received a grant from the World Bank. Using ultrasound technology, our team developed a patient height-measuring device for Sri Lankan clinical systems. We successfully addressed the challenge of low reflections due to dense scalp hair by employing a K-means clustering algorithm. This project, known as <a href="https://measureup.lk/"><em>MeasureUP</em></a>, was commercially launched as a startup and received support from the World Bank-funded AHEAD program. Under the guidance of Dr. Ajith Pasqual, I gained comprehensive experience in medical product development, from prototyping to navigating regulatory requirements and intellectual property considerations.

                In my academic background, I received <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chathura-weerasinghe-9a08bb213/details/honors/"><em>bronze medals for both the Physics and Mathematics Olympiad and secured the 9th place representing Sri Lanka at the 12th Statistics Olympiad in 2020</em></a>. For GCE Advanced level exam, I achieved 99th place out of 200,000+ candidates in Sri Lanka, with A’s in all four subjects Maths, Physics, Chemistry, and English.

                In my free time, I am interested in video and graphic designing, as well as scriptwriting and acting in dramas. Here, I have attached some of my dramas. Go and see "What the Sense of Humor through an Engineering Eye is." <a href="https://youtu.be/yPXYBtht1XQ?feature=shared"><em>1."Latha.AI"</em></a> , <a href="https://youtu.be/5t9_GxEX5Pk?feature=shared"><em>2."Parakiyana Tharuka"</em></a>.
